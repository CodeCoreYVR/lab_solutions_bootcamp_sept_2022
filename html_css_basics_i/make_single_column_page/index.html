            Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as 
            design that’s more usable.

            <li>
              An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive 
              response in people’s brains and leads them to believe 
              the design actually works better.

            <li>
              People are more tolerant of minor usability issues 
              when the design of a product or service is 
              aesthetically pleasing.

            <li>
              Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems 
              and prevent issues from being discovered during 
              usability testing.

            Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact 
            at a pace (< 400ms)  that ensures that neither has to wait 
            on the other.

              Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually 
              increase its perceived value and instill a sense of 
              trust, even when the process itself actually takes much 
              less time.
