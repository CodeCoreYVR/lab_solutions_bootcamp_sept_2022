            Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as 
            design that’s more usable.

          <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
          <ul class='list'>
            <li>
              An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive 
              response in people’s brains and leads them to believe 
              the design actually works better.
            </li>
            <li>
              People are more tolerant of minor usability issues 
              when the design of a product or service is 
              aesthetically pleasing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems 
              and prevent issues from being discovered during 
              usability testing.

            Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact 
            at a pace (< 400ms)  that ensures that neither has to wait 
            on the other.

            </li>
            <li>
              Use perceived performance to improve response time and

              Animation is one way to visually engage people while

              Progress bars help make wait times tolerable,

              Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually 
              increase its perceived value and instill a sense of 
              trust, even when the process itself actually takes much 
              less time.

            <li>

              Users will transfer expectations they have built

              By leveraging existing mental models, we can create 
              superior user experiences in which the users can 
              focus on their tasks rather than on learning new 
              models.

              When making changes, minimize discord by empowering

              Alternately, you can use a tangible connecting reference (line, arrow, etc) from one element to the next to also create a visual connection.
